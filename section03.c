 * This is a exercise from Udemy course "algoritmos-e-logica-de-programacao-essencial" by GeekUniversity.
 * This program was made to calc the average stock for the parts,
 * The variables below, receive the data of the user,
 * Minimum_quantity receive the minimum quantity of parts in the stocks,
 * Max_quantity receive the maximal quantity of parts in the stock.
 * average_stock calc the average stock of parts,
 * adding the variables minimum_quantity and max_quantity divinding per 2.
 * The result of calc is display in the output with the function printf.
